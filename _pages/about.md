Hello, my name is Bruno, and I am a master's student at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG).

I currently work on using quantitative information flow (QIF) to model fairness and privacy in machine learning. I am under the supervision of Prof. Doc. MÃ¡rio Alvim.

I have been an intern at EPFL and Aalto University. On both occasions, I worked on differential privacy in machine learning.

If you want, you can reach me by [email](mailto:brunodemattos1998@gmail.com).




[comment]: <> (Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.)

[comment]: <> (Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)

[comment]: <> (Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.)
